## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Problem: Nirog Gives Generic Responses
**Solution:**
- Be more specific about your symptoms
- Include duration, severity, and location
- Mention your age and any relevant medical history
- Ask follow-up questions for clarification

#### Problem: Responses Are Too Technical
**Solution:**
```
You: Can you explain that in simpler terms?
You: I don't understand the medical terms you used
You: Can you break that down for me?
```

#### Problem: Nirog Doesn't Remember Previous Messages
**Solution:**
- This indicates a session restart - context is lost
- Restart the conversation with `python chat_bot.py`
- Provide relevant background information again

### Technical Issues

#### Problem: Slow Response Times
**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Slow internet**: Check your connection speed
- **API rate limits**: Wait 10-15 seconds between messages

- **Server issues**: Try again in a few minutes

#### Problem: "API Key Error" Messages
**Solutions:**
1. Verify your API key in the `.env` file
2. Check for typos or extra spaces
3. Generate a new key from Google AI Studio
4. Restart your terminal after making changes

**Solutions:**
1. Check for error messages in the terminal
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure stable internet connection
4. Restart the program: `python chat_bot.py`

### Getting Better Results

#### Tips for Clearer Communication:
- **Use complete sentences** rather than single words
- **Provide context** about your situation
- **Ask specific questions** rather than general ones
- **Mention your location** for doctor recommendations
- **Be honest** about symptoms and concerns

#### Example of Effective Communication:
```
❌ Poor: "Stomach hurts"
